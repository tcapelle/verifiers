# GitHub Actions Workflows

This directory contains automated workflows for the verifiers project.

## Workflows

### 1. Style (`style.yaml`)
**Purpose**: Code style checking using ruff.

**Triggers**:
- Pull requests (opened, synchronized, reopened)
- Pushes to `main` branch

**What it does**:
- Runs ruff for linting and formatting checks
- Uses configuration from `pyproject.toml`

### 2. Test (`test.yml`)
**Purpose**: Comprehensive testing with coverage reports.

**Triggers**:
- Pull requests affecting Python files, dependencies, or workflow files
- Pushes to `main`, `master`, or `develop` branches with the same file changes

**What it does**:
- Runs tests on multiple Python versions (3.11, 3.12)
- Generates coverage reports (XML, HTML, and terminal output)
- Uploads coverage to Codecov (requires `CODECOV_TOKEN` secret)
- Uploads HTML coverage reports as artifacts
- Comments on PRs with test results

## Setting Up

### Branch Protection
It's recommended to set up branch protection rules for your main branch:
1. Go to Settings â†’ Branches
2. Add a rule for your main branch
3. Enable "Require status checks to pass before merging"
4. Select the CI jobs you want to require

## Running Tests Locally

To run tests locally the same way they run in CI:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -e .
pip install pytest pytest-asyncio pytest-cov

# Run tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run tests with coverage
python -m pytest tests/ -v --cov=verifiers --cov-report=html
```

## Customization

### Adding New Python Versions
Edit the `matrix.python-version` in the workflow files to test on additional Python versions.

### Changing Trigger Conditions
Modify the `on:` section in the workflow files to change when workflows run.

### Adding More Checks
You can extend the workflows to include:
- Type checking with mypy
- Security scanning
- Documentation building
- Package building and publishing
